# essentials
My basic Minecraft plugin.

## what is this?

This is a custom Minecraft plugin, written for version 1.12.2 (may work on higher versions of the game.) It contains tools for users and server admins, to make the Minecraft server experience just a little cooler.

**This is beta software! There will be bugs, so work with me here!**

### current features

- fly mode
- god mode
- custom nicknames
- custom join & leave messages
- custom message formatting

### good for server admins!
- lightweight, open-source, and easily auditable
- no proprietary bloat/apis
- easily configurable (see [config.yml](src/main/resources/config.yml))

## how to install

### building from source

I build and program inside of the IntelliJ IDE. You can `git clone` the repository, import it into IntelliJ, and do a quick and easy maven package!

### release archives

currently unavailable, due to the beta state of the software. as more features are rolled out I will look to an official release, and with that will come release archives.

## thanks!

Thank you for your interest in this project! I recommend using the [PaperMC server jar](https://papermc.io) with this plugin for the best performance and compatibility possible.
